（1）This dataset is about Commit Message Generation (CMG) tasks in the domain of software engineering. Among them, commit messages can be distinguished into two types according to their semantics: explicit and implicit commit messages. Explicit commit messages are surface-level descriptions of code changes and directly reflect code modifications. The implicit commit message is a summary of the logic of the code change, which reflects the deep meaning of the code change. CMG is often modeled as a seq2seq task, that is, from code changes, commonly formatted as diff, to commit messages.

（2）Since the size of the dataset is large and exceeds the commit limit, we have stored the dataset in Google Cloud Drive, see the link:：
