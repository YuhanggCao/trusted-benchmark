（1）This dataset is about the bytecode method-level comment generation task in the field of software engineering. Bytecode is an intermediate representation that is understood and executed by a virtual machine after a program written in a high-level language is compiled. Similar to traditional comment generation tasks, this task is usually modeled as a seq2seq task, that is, from code changes (usually in the form of diff) to commit messages.
